# Matrix
![MATRIX](./images/)

**This project is a class for convenient work with matrices and performing various operations with them.**

* The code is written according to google style
* Handling of exceptional situations
* The program includes such operations on matrices as:
  + Checks matrices for equality with each other - bool eq_matrix(const S21Matrix& other)
  + Adds the second matrix to the current one - void sum_matrix(const S21Matrix& other)
  + Subtracts another matrix from the current one - void sub_matrix(const S21Matrix& other)
  + Multiplies the current matrix by a number - void mul_number(const double num)
  + Multiplies the current matrix by the second matrix - void mul_matrix(const S21Matrix& other)
  + Creates a new transposed matrix from the current one and returns it - S21Matrix transpose()
  + Calculates the algebraic addition matrix of the current one and returns it - S21Matrix calc_complements()
  + Calculates and returns the determinant of the current matrix - double determinant()
  + Calculates and returns the inverse matrix - S21Matrix inverse_matrix()
* Constructors and destructors such as:
  + A basic constructor that initialises a matrix of some predefined dimension - S21Matrix()
  + Parametrized constructor with number of rows and columns - S21Matrix(int rows, int cols) 
  + Copy constructor - S21Matrix(const S21Matrix& other)
  + Move constructor - S21Matrix(S21Matrix&& other)
  + Destructor - ~S21Matrix()
* The program includes such overloaded operators as:
  + Addition of two matrices - '+'
  + Subtraction of one matrix from another - '-'
  + Matrix multiplication and matrix multiplication by a number - '*'
  + Checks for matrices equality - '=='
  + Assignment of values from one matrix to another one - '='
  + Addition assignment - '+='
  + Difference assignment - '-='
  + Multiplication assignment - '*='
  + Indexation by matrix elements (row, column) - '(int i, int j)'
